# RevoltVoice Live - Simple React App Configuration

# This is an example file. Copy this to .env.local for Create React App
# Create React App will automatically load .env.local files

# Google Gemini API Key
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here

# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com
# REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Note: In this simple React app version, the API key is entered directly in the UI
# This is safe since it's stored only in localStorage and never exposed to servers

# Alternative: If you want to embed the API key in build (not recommended for production):
# Uncomment the line above and set your API key there
